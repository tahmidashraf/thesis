A fractional real-estate tokenization system using blockchain technology to solve the challenges of fractional real-estate ownership.


This is a thesis which I have done based on the situation of the crowded capital of Bangladesh. I 
proposed a system where people can buy properties in fractions using blockchain technology. 
We have used celo public blockchain technology here to implement this system. The type of token we have used is ERC-1155 token.
